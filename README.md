# Project--Predictive-Model-for-Personal-Loans
- A project on building predictive model for identifying potential loan acceptors. 

Problem Statement: Universal Bank is a new bank with a rapidly growing customer base. Most of these customers are liability customers (depositors with checking/savings accounts). 
The customer base of asset customers (borrowers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this sector to bring in more loan revenue. It wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers. 
Last year, Universal Bank ran a marketing campaign where they offered personal loans to select customers. The bank has data from this campaign where it can see which customers accepted/rejected the loan offers. 
Universal bank wants to deploy a predictive model capable of identifying customers who are most likely to accept the personal loan in the next marketing campaign. 

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model to help the bank. More details are mentioned in the 'Universal Bank Predictive Model Project' pdf file and the python code is in the UniversalBank_project ipynb file.
